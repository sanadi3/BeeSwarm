# ECSE 250 Assignment 1 Instruction
## Folder Structure
<pre>
  +--- src  
      +---assignment1
          +--- your java files  
      +--- Main.java //you can write your own test cases in this file or just delete this file if you want
      ...  

</pre>

After you pull the repository, you should notice that there is one folder: **src** 
You should create and write the required implemented Java classes inside the **src/assignment1** folder.  



## Submission Instruction
You should only submit the required Java files.
We have added a .gitignore file so that it will automatically ignore some unnecessary files when you push, but still be careful when you push (use git add <> as required) your project.


**All your work must be submitted on GitHub. Similar to previous weekly assignments, only your code on GitHub will be graded. For more details, refer to the Assignment Specifications released on MyCourses.**

### Important
Please make sure that all the java files you submit are part of a package called assignment1. 
Your assignment1 package should be put into the src folder when you push to GitHub. In other words, you will have your .java files in folder assignment1 and your assignment1 folder should be in folder src. Failing to do so will result in 10% penalties.
